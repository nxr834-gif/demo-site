    <h1>The short story of Sam the Hobbit</h1>
    <p>Sam Tripp looks like a hobbit that never found a way out of its hole. 
        He is from a big hole. <br>
        The biggest hole out of any other hobbit. During his time in his hole he <br>   
        enjoys eating goat cheese from his indoor pet goat named jerry, and he also enjoys <br>
        smoking grass in his brass pipe.
    <h2> Lifestyle of Sam the hobbit</h2>
    <p>Sam's daily routine consists of physical labor. <br> 
       He cares for his plants, cleans the pathway that stretches from the front of his <br> 
       lawn to the front of his doorstep, and he gives his goat a bath.</p>
